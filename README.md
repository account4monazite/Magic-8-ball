This  is my second project in  python
There are 3 versions of the 8ball
First verion is the '8ball w no jazz' where it has a simple text to speech, the image and answers
Then, after many trial and errors, i got the image to move
Futher customized it with colors 
The Second version is : '8ball (funne)' which is just hilarious
And the final version is: '8ball with crack jazz'
Thank youâœ¨"# Magic-8-ball"
